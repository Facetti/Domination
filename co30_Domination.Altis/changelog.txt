- Added: Lights at base and main target illumination (SPE flares module) in the SPE version because nights were too dark
- Changed: Disable ambient radio chatter in SPE and IFA3 versions
- Improved: Remove killed AI units in buildings immediately if no player is nearby (dead units eat up a lot of FPS)
- Fixed: "Error: No Unit" problems with the best player at main target dialog (only players actually still playing are shown, hopefully fixed)
- Fixed: When a squad leader died when a player selected respawn at SL the player could end up at position [0, 0, 0]
- Fixed: WheeldTracked APCs did not spawn gunners in the SPE version (and probably other versions)
- Fixed: Do not run quick cleanup when persistent corpses is enabled, by longtime
- Fixed: Spawn fewer civilians when low/med/high/veryhigh/extreme is selected, by longtime
- Fixed: Cleanup could target an undefined trigger, by longtime
