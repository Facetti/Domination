- Added: Lights at base and main target illumination (SPE flares module) in the SPE version because nights were too dark
- Changed: Disable ambient radio chatter in SPE and IFA3 versions
- Changed: If server is unranked then players can create a UAV anywhere (not restricted to a deployed MHQ), by longtime
- Changed: Combat UAV will reposition to new maintarget when previous target in cleared, by longtime
- Changed: d_snp_aware is now a configurable distance, 0 no awareness, 1 is unchanged (1200m like before) or awareness is set by property value 100m-2000m, by longtime
- Changed: More flares at night at main targets in the normal versions (non SPE versions)
- Changed: Cooldown phase now also for normal AT rockets if fired close to an ammo box (avoids spamming targets with rockets)
- Improved: Remove killed AI units in buildings immediately if no player is nearby (dead units eat up a lot of FPS)
- Improved: Better protection for base AA vehicles so that players can't enter them
- Fixed: "Error: No Unit" problems with the best player at main target dialog (only players actually still playing are shown, hopefully fixed)
- Fixed: When a squad leader died when a player selected respawn at SL the player could end up at position [0, 0, 0]
- Fixed: WheeldTracked APCs did not spawn gunners in the SPE version (and probably other versions)
- Fixed: Do not run quick cleanup when persistent corpses is enabled, by longtime
- Fixed: Spawn fewer civilians when low/med/high/veryhigh/extreme is selected, by longtime
- Fixed: Cleanup could target an undefined trigger, by longtime
- Fixed: Combat UAV loiters closer to maintarget, altitude lowered from 2000m to 1100m, vehicle lights are off, by longtime
- Fixed: No mines during preemptive event, by longtime
- Fixed: When closing Virtual Arsenal players ended up in a standing stance even when they were prone when opening it
- Fixed: Turn NV for camera off when specatating dialog starts at night (otherwise the NV button shows the wrong state)
- Fixed: Deleted cooldown rocket/missile projectiles are now deleted globally and not only on the client who fired
- Fixed: SPE explosives did not destroy side mission tanks
